# Plan — Standalone Solver & PrePoMax Feature Parity

Companion log: [`SOLVER_AND_PREPOMAX_LOG.md`](SOLVER_AND_PREPOMAX_LOG.md) (written as work is completed and verified).

## 1. Honest scope statement
PrePoMax is a front end for CalculiX, a 25-year-old general-purpose FE code. Matching *everything*
either of them does (contact, NLGEOM, shells/beams, CAD import, CFD…) is a multi-year effort.
This plan therefore defines **what this change set delivers and verifies**, and lists the rest as an
explicit roadmap so nothing is implied that does not exist.

## 2. Solver: standalone engine (replaces CalculiX entirely)

### Decisions
| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| S0 | New package `backend/app/fea/` — pure NumPy/SciPy, **no external binary**. `calculix.py` and every `ccx` reference are removed (code, Dockerfile apt step, health flag, UI text). |
| S1 | Vectorised assembly (batched `einsum`) replaces the per-element Python loop — an order of magnitude faster. |
| S2 | Element library uses **CalculiX/Abaqus node ordering** so `.inp` import/export round-trips: `C3D4`, `C3D10`, `C3D8`, `C3D20`. |
| S3 | Every analysis is verified against a closed-form solution in an automated test (see §5). |
| S4 | A CalculiX-compatible `.inp` **exporter/importer** is kept as an *interoperability* feature (PrePoMax does the same). It never runs `ccx`. |

## 4. Architecture of the change
```
backend/app/fea/
  elements.py      shape functions, Gauss rules, faces (tri3/tri6/quad4/quad8)
  model.py         FEMesh (nodes, connectivity, boundary faces, quality)
  materials.py     elastic D matrix, J2 return mapping + consistent tangent
  assembly.py      K, M, thermal K/C, Kσ, body/face loads (vectorised)
  constraints.py   reference points, rigid body, tie -> transformation T
  analyses.py      static, nonlinear, frequency, buckling, heat, transient, thermomech, dynamic
  recovery.py      stress/strain/flux recovery, nodal extrapolation, derived scalars
  inp.py           CalculiX .inp export / import
  runner.py        project JSON -> analyses -> result JSON
backend/app/mesh_gen.py  (extends mesh.py)  primitives, hex/tet, quadratic, quality
backend/tests/fea/       analytic benchmarks
frontend/…               new panels, result tools, project I/O
```
Data model additions on `projects`: `element_type`, `settings` (step parameters), `reference_points`,
`constraints`, `node_sets`; new load/BC types stay inside the existing JSON columns.

## 5. Verification (each is an automated test)
| Benchmark | Closed form |
|---|---|
| Uniaxial bar, all 4 element types | σ = F/A, δ = FL/AE (exact) |
| Cantilever tip deflection (Tet10, Hex20) | δ = PL³/3EI (± few %) |
| Thermal expansion of a free bar | δ = αΔT·L, σ = 0; fixed bar σ = −EαΔT |
| Cantilever first frequency | f₁ = (1.875²/2πL²)√(EI/ρA) |
| Euler column buckling | P_cr = π²EI/(4L²) |
| 1-D steady conduction; transient slab | linear profile; series solution |
| Convection / radiation balance | analytic equilibrium temperature |
| Elastic–plastic bar (bilinear) | σ = σy + H·εp, unload to residual strain |
| Newmark SDOF-like bar | period vs. analytic |
| Rigid body & tie | rigid motion reproduced exactly; tie vs. continuous mesh |
| Rotational patch tests | constant-strain patch reproduced exactly |
